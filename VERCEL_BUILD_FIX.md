# Vercel Build Fix - NotionTiptapEditor

## Issues
The build was failing with multiple errors:
1. `"QuoteIcon" is not exported by "node_modules/@shopify/polaris-icons/dist/index.mjs"`
2. `"TableIcon" is not exported by "node_modules/@shopify/polaris-icons/dist/index.mjs"`
3. Many other icons from Polaris Icons library don't actually exist

## Root Cause
Many of the icons I initially used (QuoteIcon, TableIcon, BoldIcon, ItalicIcon, etc.) do not exist in the Shopify Polaris Icons library. This was causing the build to fail during the module transformation phase.

## Solution
Created a custom `TextIcon` component that uses emoji and text symbols instead of Polaris icons. This approach:
1. Removes all dependencies on non-existent Polaris icons
2. Maintains visual consistency with simple, recognizable symbols
3. Works across all browsers and platforms
4. Keeps the MagicIcon from Polaris for the AI button (which does exist)

## Changes Made
1. Removed all non-existent icon imports except `MagicIcon`
2. Created a `TextIcon` component with emoji/text mappings:
   - Bold: `ùêÅ`
   - Italic: `ùêº`
   - Underline: `UÃ≤`
   - Table: `‚äû`
   - Quote: `‚ùù`
   - And many more...
3. Replaced all icon references with the TextIcon component
4. Kept the Polaris MagicIcon for the AI button only

## Verification
- Only imports MagicIcon from Polaris Icons (which is confirmed to exist)
- All other icons use the custom TextIcon component
- The editor functionality remains unchanged
- All features work as expected with the new icon system

## Benefits
- No more dependency on specific Polaris icons that may or may not exist
- More portable and maintainable
- Still looks good and is functional
- Easier to customize icons in the future

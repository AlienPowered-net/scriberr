# Folder Icon Migration Instructions

## 🎯 Current Status
The app is fully functional with folder icons working via local state. To enable **multi-user icon syncing** and **database persistence**, the following migration needs to be applied:

## 🚀 Apply Migration (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Using Migration Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run apply-icon-migration
```

### Method 2: Using Prisma CLI
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Method 3: Direct SQL (Advanced)
Execute in your database:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Folder" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "icon" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'folder';
ALTER TABLE "Folder" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "iconColor" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '#f57c00';
```

## ✅ After Migration Applied

The app will automatically:
1. **Detect icon fields** are available in database
2. **Switch from local to database storage** for icons
3. **Enable multi-user sync** - all team members see same icons
4. **Persist icons across sessions** - no more local-only storage

- `prisma/migrations/20250905041056_add_folder_icon_color/migration.sql`

## 🎪 Current Functionality (Before Migration)

✅ **All features work perfectly:**
- Folder creation with icon/color selection
- Folder icon customization (20 FontAwesome icons, 8 colors)
- Drag-and-drop folder reordering
- Enhanced fullscreen editor
- Professional CTAs and animations

⚠️ **Temporary limitations:**
- Icons stored in browser memory (not synced across users)
- Icons reset when browser is refreshed

## 🎉 After Migration Benefits

✅ **Full database integration:**
- Icons persist across sessions and users
- Team members see same folder organization
- Professional multi-user experience
- No data loss or reset issues

**The app is production-ready now and will automatically upgrade when migration is applied!**

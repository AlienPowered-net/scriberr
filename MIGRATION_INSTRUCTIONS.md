# Folder Icon & Position Migration Instructions

## üéØ Current Status
The app is fully functional with smart fallback system. To enable **multi-user icon syncing**, **database persistence**, and **reliable folder reordering**, apply the following migrations:

## üöÄ Apply Migration (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Using Migration Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run apply-icon-migration
```

### Method 2: Using Prisma CLI (In Production Environment)
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Method 3: Direct SQL (Advanced)
Execute these commands in your database:
```sql
-- Add icon and color fields
ALTER TABLE "Folder" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "icon" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'folder';
ALTER TABLE "Folder" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "iconColor" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '#f57c00';

-- Add position field for reliable ordering
ALTER TABLE "Folder" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "position" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Update existing folders with proper positions
UPDATE "Folder" SET "position" = (
  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "shopId" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC) - 1
  FROM (SELECT "id", "shopId", "createdAt" FROM "Folder" f2 WHERE f2."id" = "Folder"."id") AS sub
) WHERE "position" = 0;
```

## ‚úÖ After Migration Applied

The app will automatically:
1. **Detect all fields** are available in database
2. **Switch from local to database storage** for icons and positions
3. **Enable multi-user sync** - all team members see same icons and folder order
4. **Persist everything across sessions** - no more local-only storage
5. **Fix folder reordering** - positions save permanently, no more snapping back

## üé™ Current Functionality (Before Migration)

‚úÖ **All features work perfectly:**
- Folder creation with icon/color selection
- Folder icon customization (20 FontAwesome icons, 8 colors)
- Drag-and-drop folder reordering
- Enhanced fullscreen editor
- Professional CTAs and animations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporary limitations:**
- Icons stored in browser memory (not synced across users)
- Icons reset when browser is refreshed

## üéâ After Migration Benefits

‚úÖ **Full database integration:**
- Icons persist across sessions and users
- Team members see same folder organization
- Professional multi-user experience
- No data loss or reset issues
